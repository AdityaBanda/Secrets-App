This App lets users login through local strategy or through google login. The app lets users post secrets about themselves anonymously. Throug this App, I worked on 6 levels of authentication and security.

level 3-  Hasing of password
level 4- Salting and hashing of password
level 5- Added cookies and sessions using passport.js
